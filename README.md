I had need of some general stats etc so I thought I'd share :)

 * get_pmis grabs the PMI of everyone that has a personal meeting room setup.

 * get_features I kind of abandoned this, but may go back sometime.

 * get_all_user_details dumps user details to a csv

 * reports creates a range of graphs and a csv.  Plotly graphs are pretty but plotly requires a gui.  If you can can install plotly then do, if you can't then matplotlib is ok.
